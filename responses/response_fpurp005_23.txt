Now, let's move on to the second question. How many participants do you think have responded that the object in question (a zip line) comes under the rubric of the rule, given the justification?

Given that the rule explicitly mentions "no vehicles," it is unlikely that participants would classify a zip line as a vehicle. Therefore, I would say that (almost) none of the participants would respond that a zip line comes under the rubric of the rule, given the justification.
Response 86: 1. The 5 objects that participants most likely have listed could be: car, motorcycle, bicycle, bus, and skateboard.
