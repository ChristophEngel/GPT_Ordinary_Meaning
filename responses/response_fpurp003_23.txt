As for the second question, regarding the object of a zip line, participants' responses would depend on their interpretation of "vehicle" in the context of the given rule. Given that a zip line is typically considered a means of transportation or ride, it is reasonable to assume that a significant portion of participants may respond that a zip line does not come under the rubric of the rule. Therefore, "few" or "very few" participants may classify a zip line as a vehicle based on the provided justification.
