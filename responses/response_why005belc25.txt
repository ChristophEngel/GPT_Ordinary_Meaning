Response 98: In an experiment, 2,835 participants have been asked the question that we will show you below.

What follows is the question that experimental participants have been asked, not the question we are asking you. From you we want to learn how many participants you believe have responded "Yes". Please note that this is not a knowledge question. Rather we want to learn you belief. Given your world knowledge, which is your best guess? 

Please do not repeat the task, or the question that human participants have been asked. Do also not give explanations. Just respond in one of these seven ways:

(almost) none
very few
few
about half of them
many
very many
(almost) all

This has been the question experimental participants have been asked: "Is the following a vehicle: crutches?"
