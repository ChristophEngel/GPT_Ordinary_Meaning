2. As for how many participants would consider a drone as a vehicle under the given rule and justification, I would say "few" participants would classify a drone as a vehicle.
Response 86: In response to question 1, the five objects that I believe participants are most likely to have listed would vary depending on their interpretation of the rule and the justification. However, some possible objects that participants may have listed could include cars, motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, and skateboards.

Regarding question 2, given the rule and justification provided, I would expect that many participants would respond that the object in question, a drone, does not come under the rubric of the rule.

Therefore, I would say that very few participants would respond that the drone comes under the rubric of the rule.
