2. As an AI language model, I don't have access to data or statistics on the specific experiment you mentioned. However, based on the given justification, I would speculate that many participants might respond that the object in question, an airplane, does not come under the rubric of the rule. Airplanes are typically not classified as vehicles that would be present in a park and cause damage to grass, gardens, or small structures. Therefore, my estimation would be "very few" participants would respond that the airplane falls under the rubric of the rule.
