Response 95: 1. The five objects that participants are most likely to list could include:

- Cars: Since the rule explicitly mentions "vehicles" and the justification mentions damage caused by vehicles, cars are a common type of vehicle that participants may think of.
- Bicycles: Bikes are another common mode of transportation that could be considered a vehicle, and participants may list them as objects covered by the rule.
- Motorcycles: Similar to cars, motorcycles are a type of vehicle that participants may think of due to the rule's mention of vehicles and the justification referring to damage caused by them.
- Trucks: Participants may list trucks as vehicles covered by the rule, considering their potential to cause damage to the grass, gardens, and structures in the park.
- Vans: Vans, like other types of vehicles, may be mentioned by participants as objects that fall under the rule due to their potential to cause damage.

2. Based on the information given, it is difficult to estimate the exact number of participants who would respond that a golf cart comes under the rubric of the rule. However, given that the rule explicitly states "no vehicles," and the justification mentions damage caused by vehicles, it is reasonable to assume that:

- (Almost) none or very few participants would respond that a golf cart comes under the rubric of the rule. This is because golf carts are generally not considered traditional vehicles, and participants may interpret the rule as referring to larger, more common types of vehicles like cars, motorcycles, or trucks.
