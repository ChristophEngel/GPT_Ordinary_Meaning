Response 96: 1. The 5 objects that participants most likely have listed could include:
- Cars
- Bicycles
- Motorcycles
- Skateboards

2. In response to the question of whether the object in question (an airplane) comes under the rubric of the rule, given the justification, I believe (almost) none of the participants would respond affirmatively.
Response 97: 1. The five objects that participants may have listed are:
- Car
- Bicycle
- Scooter
- Motorcycle
- Skateboard

2. I think the majority of participants would respond that the object in question, an airplane, does not come under the rubric of the rule. Therefore, the response would be (almost) none.
Response 98: We cannot accurately determine the objects that participants have listed without having access to the data from the experiment. However, it is possible that participants may have listed objects such as cars, bicycles, motorcycles, skateboards, and scooters as potential examples of vehicles.

As for the second question, given the justification provided, it is likely that (almost) all participants would have responded that an airplane does not come under the rubric of the rule. This is because the rule specifically mentions accidents involving collisions between pedestrians and cars or bicycles, implying that vehicles within the park are restricted to those that can physically collide with pedestrians. Since airplanes typically do not operate within the confines of a park and do not pose the same collision risks as cars or bicycles, most participants would likely conclude that airplanes are not included in the rule.

Response 114: We cannot say for certain which objects the participants are most likely to have listed as it depends on individual interpretations and opinions. However, it is possible that some common objects that participants may have listed could include cars, bicycles, motorcycles, scooters, and skateboards.

As for the second question, it is likely that most participants would respond that an airplane does not come under the rubric of the rule. Since the rule specifically mentions accidents involving collisions between inattentive pedestrians and cars or bicycles, an airplane would not typically fall under this category. Therefore, we can expect (almost) none or very few participants to respond that an airplane comes under the rubric of the rule.
