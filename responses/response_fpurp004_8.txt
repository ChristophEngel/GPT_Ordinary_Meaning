   - Cars
   - Bicycles
   - Motorcycles
   - Trucks
   - Rollerblades/skateboards

2. In response to the question of whether the object "ambulance" comes under the rubric of the rule, given the justification, I would speculate that the answer could be: (almost) none.

Please note that these are speculative answers and actual responses from participants may vary.
Response 123: We cannot determine the 5 objects that participants have listed as it would require access to the data from the experiment.

As for the second question, we can make an assumption based on the information provided. Given that the object in question is an ambulance, which is commonly recognized as a vehicle, and the rule explicitly states "no vehicles in the park," we can assume that (almost) all participants would respond that the ambulance comes under the rubric of the rule.
