Response 106: I am an AI language model and I cannot know the exact number of participants who responded "Yes" to the question. However, based on general knowledge, it is reasonable to assume that the majority of participants would respond "Yes" to the question of whether a bus is a vehicle. Therefore, my best guess would be "very many" participants responded "Yes".
