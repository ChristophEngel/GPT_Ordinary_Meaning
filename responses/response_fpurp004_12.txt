(almost) none
Response 112: 1. The objects that participants are most likely to have listed could include cars, motorcycles, bicycles, skateboards, and scooters. These are common modes of transportation that are often found in parks and could potentially cause damage.

2. Given the justification that vehicles in the park have caused damage to the grass, gardens, and structures, I would say that many participants would respond that a helicopter does not come under the rubric of the rule. Helicopters are not typically associated with being driven or parked in parks, and they are less likely to cause direct damage to the mentioned elements. Therefore, I would say that very few participants would respond that a helicopter comes under the rubric of the rule.
