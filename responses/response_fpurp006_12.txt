Response 76: As an AI language model, I can provide a plausible answer based on common beliefs and assumptions. However, since I cannot access specific data about the participants or the experiment, my response will be speculative.

1. Which are the 5 objects that you consider most likely participants have listed?
Possible objects that participants might have listed could include:
- Cars
- Bicycles
- Motorcycles
- Skateboards
- Rollerblades

2. How many participants do you think have responded that the object in question comes under the rubric of the rule, given the justification?
Given the justification that vehicles diminish the beauty of the park, the number of participants who would respond that a helicopter falls under the rule depends on their interpretation. 

Assuming a conservative approach where participants consider a helicopter to be a vehicle, it is likely that:
- Almost none or very few participants would classify a helicopter as a vehicle under the rule since helicopters are not common in parks and might not visually diminish their beauty.

However, if participants interpret the rule strictly and believe that any form of transportation is a vehicle, then:
- Many or very many participants might classify a helicopter as a vehicle and thus believe it falls under the rubric of the rule.

The exact proportion of participants who would classify a helicopter as a vehicle under the given justification is difficult to determine without specific information about the sample group and their individual perspectives.
