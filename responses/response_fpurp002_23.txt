It is difficult to precisely estimate the response of the participants without more information about their background and the context of the experiment. However, based on the given justification, we can make an educated guess.

Based on the given justification, it is unlikely that participants would consider a zip line to fall under the category of a vehicle. While the justification focuses on accidents involving collisions between pedestrians and cars or bicycles, a zip line is a mode of transport that typically operates in a controlled environment with minimal interaction with pedestrians. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that:

(almost) none - very few participants would respond that a zip line comes under the rubric of the rule.
